    <h1>The TSA Nationals Experience</h1>
    <h2><strong>Flying to Nationals, facing the unexpected, and learning more from losing than winning.</strong></h2>

    <p>Heading to TSA Nationals felt like a dream. After months of prep and qualifying at states, I was finally in Louisville, surrounded by thousands of sharp, ambitious students in matching polos and badges. It was electric.</p>

    <p>I competed in Forensic Science — an event that tested not just knowledge, but nerves. My partner and I had trained like crazy. We were ready. But then... we didn’t place.</p>

    <p>I won't lie — it stung. But instead of walking away bitter, I stayed to watch other events. I talked to students who had competed for years. And I realized that what matters isn’t the medal. It’s the mindset. How you grow. How you take what didn’t work and make it better next time.</p>

    <p>Since then, I’ve committed to improving — not just in content, but in composure, strategy, and teamwork. Nationals gave me more than a score. It gave me perspective.</p>
