  <p>This summer, I had the opportunity to compete at the TSA National Conference in Nashville. It was my first time qualifying for Nationals — and walking into a ballroom filled with thousands of competitors was surreal.</p>

  <p>Our Forensics team had spent weeks preparing. From theory tests to simulated crime scenes, every detail mattered. The process of learning so much about forensic science was genuinely exciting. Although we didn’t place, we left the competition more confident and focused on how to improve. I gained friends, mentors, and a clear goal for next year.</p>

  <p>What stood out most wasn't the competition — it was the energy. Everyone there had built something. The future is bright, and I’m proud to be part of it.</p>
