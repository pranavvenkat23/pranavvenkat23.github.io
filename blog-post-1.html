    <h1>Lessons from TSA Forensic Science</h1>
    <h2>A national competition, a mock crime scene, and everything in between.</h2>

    <p>This past year, I competed in the TSA Forensic Science event with my partner, and it was nothing short of intense. From analyzing crime scene evidence to building a theoretical case under time pressure, the event pushed both my critical thinking and communication skills to new levels.</p>

    <p>The national theory round was an eye-opener — filled with tricky chemistry, fingerprint matching, and scenario-based questions that tested our attention to detail. We studied dozens of past tests and learned to work efficiently as a team. Though we didn’t make it to the final round, we walked away with something more valuable: confidence, strategy, and clarity on how we could approach real-world scientific problems in the future.</p>

    <p>TSA helped me realize that success isn’t always about winning a medal. It’s about the growth that happens when you're pushed outside your comfort zone. I’m walking into next year’s competitions with more fire and a lot more focus.</p>
