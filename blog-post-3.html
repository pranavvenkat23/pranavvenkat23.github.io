  <h1>Why I Love LD Debate</h1>

  <p>I remember walking into my first Lincoln-Douglas debate round with shaking hands and a heart that beat like a drumline. Fast-forward a year, and I now lead our school’s LD team.</p>

  <p>Debate taught me how to think, but more importantly, it taught me how to listen. Some of my best rounds weren’t won by fancy rhetoric — they were won by adapting on the fly, by understanding my opponent’s values better than they understood mine.</p>

  <p>I’ve also learned that advocacy isn’t about being loud. It’s about being heard. And that’s something I’ll carry far beyond high school.</p>
