  <p>This summer, I joined a computational biology research team focused on antimicrobial peptide discovery. We used a database called GRAMPA and machine learning models to predict peptides that might work against drug-resistant bacteria.</p>

  <p>Coming from a neuroscience interest, I didn’t expect to love this project — but I did. It made me realize how important cross-field fluency is. Biology is interconnected. A tool from neuroscience might one day unlock answers in virology, oncology, or pharmacology.</p>

  <p>My biggest takeaway: be curious across disciplines. Great research happens in the overlaps.</p>
