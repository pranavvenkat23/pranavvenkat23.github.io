    <h2><strong>Learning to think fast, speak clearly, and lose gracefully.</strong></h2>

    <p>When I first joined Lincoln-Douglas debate, I was intimidated by the jargon, the speed, and the idea of arguing for things I didn’t always agree with. But that’s what made it fun.</p>

    <p>LD isn't about yelling or memorizing arguments — it's about logic, empathy, and structure. I quickly learned how to break down a resolution, anticipate my opponent’s case, and build my own argument in real time.</p>

    <p>One of my most valuable experiences was actually a loss. I had prepped for weeks and still got blindsided by a judge’s unexpected interpretation. At first, I was frustrated. But that round taught me to adapt, stay composed, and not tie my self-worth to a ballot.</p>

    <p>Now, I compete not just to win, but to improve. Every round sharpens my mind — and honestly, it’s made me a better student, writer, and thinker outside of debate too.</p>

    <p>I’ve still got a lot to learn, but I’m grateful LD pushed me out of my comfort zone. If you want to grow as a communicator — jump in.</p>
