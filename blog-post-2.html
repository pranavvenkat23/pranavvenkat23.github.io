    <h1>What Debate Taught Me (That Biology Never Did)</h1>
    <h2>Learning to listen harder, argue better, and think on my feet.</h2>

    <p>I joined Lincoln-Douglas debate thinking it would be all logic and evidence — and don’t get me wrong, it is. But what I didn’t expect was how much it would change the way I see the world, and myself.</p>

    <p>Debate taught me how to speak with precision under pressure. It taught me that being right isn’t enough — you also have to be persuasive. Some of the most valuable lessons came from losses, when judges gave brutally honest feedback that made me rethink everything from structure to tone.</p>

    <p>More than anything, debate gave me confidence. Not the loud, look-at-me kind — but the quiet confidence of knowing I can defend my ideas, challenge others respectfully, and speak with clarity in a room full of people. And honestly, that’s a life skill I’ll carry well beyond the next tournament.</p>
